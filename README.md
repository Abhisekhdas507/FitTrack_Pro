# FitTrack_Pro
FitTrack Pro is a personalized fitness tracker web application designed to help users monitor and improve their health and wellness journey. It allows users to explore a wide range of exercises, filter workouts based on body part, equipment, or target muscle, and access detailed exercise information with clear reference images. A key highlight of the app is the Progress Page, where users receive personalized suggestions for diet plans, exercise routines, daily schedules, and fitness goals—tailored to their age, activity level, weight, and dietary preference. User data is saved in localStorage to ensure persistence across sessions.

The app emphasizes a clean and responsive UI/UX using Tailwind CSS, ensuring a seamless experience across devices. It uses Redux Toolkit for managing user state and dynamic data interactions efficiently. Exercise content is fetched from the Free Exercise DB API, making the app scalable and data-driven. FitTrack Pro is an ideal project for those passionate about health-tech or looking to showcase full-stack skills in frontend development.
